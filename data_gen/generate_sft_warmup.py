"""
Generate SFT Warmup Data for Base Models (Task-Agnostic)

Creates a small JSONL dataset (~500 examples) with <think>...</think> and
<answer>...</answer> structured outputs to teach a pretrained-only model
(e.g. Qwen3-4B-Base) the expected output format before GRPO training.

IMPORTANT: Content is deliberately task-agnostic — no reasoning-gym task
content is used. This prevents the warmup from giving the model a head
start on any specific benchmark task.

Categories:
- General knowledge trivia
- Unit conversions
- Simple word/letter puzzles
- Date/time reasoning
- Vocabulary/definitions

Usage:
