If she has 20 chickens and she gives each chicken one meal of feed (since each chicken needs its own meal), that means she gives out 20 cups of feed. \\n\\nIn the morning, she gives her flock 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives them an additional 25 cups. This totals to a total of 30 cups of feed for all her chickens.\\n\\nTo find out how much feed she needs for the final meal, we subtract the amount given out from the total feed available: \\n\\n20 cups - 30 cups = -10 cups\\n\\nThis means she has less than enough feed for the final meal of the day. However, since you can't have negative cups of feed, this means she actually gave out more than enough feed for the final meal of the day. \\n\\nIf you want to know exactly how much feed she needs for the final meal, you would add back the extra feed she gave out: \\n\\n30 cups + 25 cups = 55 cups\\n\\nSo, Wendi needs to give her chickens 55 cups of feed for the final meal of the day.   \n",
